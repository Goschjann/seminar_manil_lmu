# Toy Data Sets for Seminar on Manifold Learning

LMU, Winter Semester 2020/2021

# Datasets

## Clocks

Dataset consisting of a set of circles (_clocks_) with clock hands varying clockwise. A perfect model is able to learn the 2-dimensional manifold and embed the clocks according to the clockwise ordering.

Images look as follows:

![circle 0](circle_clockh_0.png)
![circle 6](circle_clockh_6.png)

Use the script `circle_2d.py` to generate them. You can play around with various command line args such as `nrows=63`, height and width of the image, `n=50` the amount of plots to create and `delta=75` to control the thickness of the clock hands. Running the script will create a folder `circle_plots` that contains a) the plots for each of the circles and b) a `rawdata_circles.csv` containing the rawdata as flattened vectors.
